The kernels in this assignment with the default parameters set perform a
histogram operation on an image with dimensions 4096x4096 to produce a
histogram with 256 bins. Assume the kernels are configured with 1024 threads
per block. What is the maximum number of atomic operations that may be
performed on global memory for each of the following kernels?

(1) The unoptimized kernel with no privatization in shared memory or thread
    coarsening.
    -> Each thread load one pixel and store the result atomically.
    So, max number of atomic operation = max number of threads = 4096*4096 = 16777216

    
(2) The kernel with privatization in shared memory but without thread
    coarsening.
    -> Atomic operations are only done for the shared copies.
    Assuming each block have one copy of the global grid, then
    max numb of atomic operation = number of private copies * number of bins = 
    = number of blocks * number of bins 
    = (Total number of threads) / (number of threads per block)  * Total number of bins
    = (4096*4096) / 1024   * 256
    = 4194304
    

(3) The kernel with both privatization in shared memory and thread coarsening
    with a coarsening factor of 64.
    -> Each 64 input cell are being loaded by one thread
    For one block, 1024 thread loads 1024*64 = 65536 input cell.
    So we need (4096*4096)/65536 = 256 blocks.
    Each block executes 256 atomic operation, so the max number of atomic operation = 
    = (max number of blocks) * (number of atomic operation per block)
    = 256 * 256 = 65536
