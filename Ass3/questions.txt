(1) Assume that a block/tile dimension of 32x32 is used. What is the ratio of
    floating point operations to bytes loaded from global memory performed by
    each of the following kernels? Show your work.

    (a) The kernel implemented in the previous assignment (without shared memory
        tiling)

    Without shared memory, main operations were: sum = sum + A[row*N + j]*B[j*N + col];
    The variable sum is not loaded from gloabal memory.
    A[...] and B[...] are two floating points numbers loaded from global memory --> 2 x 4 = 8 bytes
    2 operations are performed: addition and multiplication
    => 2/8 = 0.25 operation/byte loaded  


    (b) The kernel implemented in this assignment (with shared memory tiling)





(2) Assume that a block/tile size of 32x32 is used, and that the program runs
    on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU (the model on the HPC cluster) which has the
    following resource constraints:
        > 2048 max threads/SM
        > 32 max blocks/SM
        > 96KB max shared-memory/SM
        > 64K max registers/SM
    Note that you can extract the resource usage of your kernel, including
    registers/thread and shared-memory/block using the folloing command:
                nvcc -c --ptxas-options="-v" kernel.cu
    Answer the following questions about occupancy for the kernel implemented
    in this assignment. Show your work.

    "ptxas info: registers/thread: 30
    shared-memory/block: 8192 bytes smem"

    (a) Is occupancy limited by the max blocks/SM?  30 reg/th * 2048 th/SM = 61440
    In the Kernel, 30 reg/th * (32 x 32) th/block = 30720 reg/block;
    64000 reg/SM / 30720 reg/block = 2.083 block/SM.
    The actual value of block/SM is way too small than the maximum it can accomodate, so it limits occupancy.


    (b) Is occupancy limited by the max shared-memory/SM?
    In the kernel, 8192 shared_mem/block * 32 block/SM = 262144 byte-shared-mem/SM = 256 KB/SM.
    For NVIDIA Tesla V100, the max shared-memory/SM is 96KB, so it's not limiting the occupency .



    (c) Is occupancy limited by the max registers/SM?
    For NVIDIA Tesla V100, the max blocks/SM is 64000.
    In the Kernel, I have 2048 th/SM * 30 reg/th = 61440 register/SM which
    is less than the maximum, so it does not limit occupancy.
